# Prog-JSSummative

<b> The Task </b><br>
Choose a sketch from openprocessing.org and adapt it into a reusable component using JavaScript classes, then build an example page with properties controlled by form controls Write documentation of your code using Markdown, JS classes include:
<ul>
<li>Appropriate constructor </li>
<li>Get and set methods for properties </li>
<li> draw method with optional p5.Renderer as parameter </li>
</ul>

<b> The Original Sketch </b> <br>

<br>

<b> My OpenProcessing File </b> <br>

<b> Possible Changes to Improve Original Code </b>
<ul>
  <li> Change particle colour / user has the option for colour? default is red orange yellow color slider</li>
  <li> Each particle can bounce </li>
  <li> when bounce they half stick </li>
  <li> stuck = smoke + tiny particles + stay and burn </li>
  <li> background slowly fills with smoke? / gets greyer </li>
  <li> Reduce the number of particles </li>
  <li> more realistic gravity </li>
  <li> Perhaps the smoke reveals a word? </li>
  <li> sparks follow the smoke? </li>
  <li> particles explode when stick? </li>
</ul>
